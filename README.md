Tennis Coding Kata
===================

This is my solution of [Tennis Coding Kata](http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataTennis) from codingdojo.org. 

Solution
--------------

After 3 months of learning Java I started to solve this kata for the first time. My [solution](https://github.com/szigya/coding-dojo-tennis/tree/first_solution) became overcomplicated and messy. I felt that it is far from acceptable, but I could not release the thought that it would be much easier to implement in php. I started to refactor and search for other codes, because I knew that I am wrong.

After a few refactoring session and inspirations from other programmers (like [Antoine Hauck](http://blog.antoine.li/2013/03/10/tennis_tdd/) ), I came up with a version which I felt much relaxing to read and share. Puzzle solved.

If you have some comments or find some issue, feel free to contribute.
